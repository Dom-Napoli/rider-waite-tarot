        <h3>History of The Rider-Waite Tarot Deck</h3>
        <h4>Source: Wikipedia for images & written content</h4>

        <h4>Overview:</h4>
        <p>
          "The Rider–Waite Tarot is a widely popular deck for tarot card
          reading.[1][2] It is also known as the Waite–Smith,[3]
          Rider–Waite–Smith,[4][5] or Rider Tarot.[4] Based on the instructions
          of academic and mystic A. E. Waite and illustrated by Pamela Colman
          Smith, both members of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, the
          cards were originally published by the Rider Company in 1909. The deck
          has been published in numerous editions and inspired a wide array of
          variants and imitations.[6][7] It is estimated that more than 100
          million copies of the deck exist in more than 20 countries.[8]"
        </p>
        <p>
          "While the images are simple, the details and backgrounds feature
          abundant symbolism. Some imagery remains similar to that found in
          earlier decks, but overall the Waite–Smith card designs are
          substantially different from their predecessors. Christian imagery was
          removed from some cards, and added to others. For example, the
          "Papess" became the "High Priestess" and no longer features a Papal
          tiara, while the "Lovers" card, previously depicting a medieval scene
          of a clothed man and woman receiving a blessing from a noble or cleric
          was changed to a depiction of the naked Adam and Eve in the Garden of
          Eden, and the ace of cups featuring a dove carrying Sacramental bread.
          The Minor Arcana are illustrated with allegorical scenes by Smith,
          where earlier decks (with a few rare exceptions) had simple designs
          for the Minor Arcana.[9]"
        </p>
        <p>
          "The symbols and imagery used in the deck were influenced by the
          19th-century magician and occultist Eliphas Levi,[10][11] as well as
          by the teachings of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn.[12] In
          order to accommodate the astrological correspondences taught by the
          Golden Dawn, Waite introduced several innovations to the deck. He
          switched the order of the Strength and Justice cards so that Strength
          corresponded with Leo and Justice corresponded with Libra.[13][14] He
          also based the Lovers card on Italian tarot decks, which have two
          persons and an angel, to reinforce its correspondence with
          Gemini.[13]"
        </p>

        <h4>Publication:</h4>
        <p>
          "The cards were first published during December 1909, by the publisher
          William Rider & Son of London.[9][13] The first printing was extremely
          limited and featured card backs with a roses and lilies pattern. A
          much larger printing was done during March of 1910, featuring better
          quality card stock and a "cracked mud" card back design. This edition,
          often referred to as the "A" deck, was published from 1910 to 1920.
          Rider continued publishing the deck in various editions until 1939,
          then again from 1971 to 1977."
        </p>
        <p>
          "All of the Rider editions up to 1939 were available with a small
          guide written by A. E. Waite providing an overview of the traditions
          and history of the cards, texts about interpretations, and extensive
          descriptions of their symbols. The first version of this guide was
          published during 1909 and was titled The Key to the Tarot. A year
          later, a revised version, The Pictorial Key to the Tarot, was issued
          that featured black-and-white plates of all seventy-eight of Smith's
          illustrations."
        </p>
        <p>
          "2009, U.S. Games Systems published a commemorative deck titled "The
          Smith-Waite Centennial Deck" as part of The Pamela Colman Smith
          Commemorative Set celebrating the hundredth anniversary of the 1909
          deck.[15] This deck notably places Smith's name first and omits the
          publisher's name (Rider). In this vein, some contemporary tarot
          readers call the original deck and its various iterations the
          "Smith-Waite deck" in order to give proper credit to Smith's
          contribution to the deck.[16]"
        </p>

        <h4>Copyright Status:</h4>
        <p>
          "The original version of the Rider–Waite Tarot is in the public domain
          in all countries that have a copyright term of 70 years or fewer after
          the death of the last co-author. This includes the United Kingdom,
          where the deck was originally published.[17] <br /><br />"In the
          United States, the deck became part of the public domain in 1966
          (publication + 28 years + renewed 28 years), and thus has been
          available for use by American artists for numerous different media
          projects. U.S. Games Systems has a copyright claim on their updated
          version of the deck published in 1971, but this only applies to new
          material added to the pre-existing work (e.g. designs on the card
          backs and the box).""
