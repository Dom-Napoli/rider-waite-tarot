She wants to sing of her freedom to her heart's content, but is found resting on the skelton. The skelton represents an unkown state. She is holding the skull of a dog; her, the skull, and the skelton look powerless. The flower is the chrysantemum and symbolizes peace. It has been maintained and sustained by consuming the fallen skelton. It is so close and yet unseen by the girl suggesting peace will be unknown in her journey at this stage. Nevertheless, she reassures herself knowing things will be alright as she has just begun her long journey which will complete at the world." -->
